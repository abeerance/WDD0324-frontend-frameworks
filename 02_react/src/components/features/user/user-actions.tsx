/**
 * UserActions Component
 *
 * Provides interactive action buttons for user-related operations within a profile context.
 * This component serves as the primary call-to-action section, offering two main interactions:
 * - Send Message: Primary action for initiating communication
 * - View Profile: Secondary action for detailed profile viewing
 *
 * Client-side component: Uses "use client" directive for interactivity in Next.js app router.
 * Currently implements placeholder functionality with console logging for development purposes.
 *
 * Design patterns:
 * - Primary/secondary button hierarchy through color contrast
 * - Equal width distribution with flex-1 for balanced layout
 * - Hover states with smooth transitions for enhanced user feedback
 * - Self-contained component with no external dependencies
 *
 * @returns JSX element containing action buttons with development placeholder handlers
